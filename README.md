# Recipe Finder Vue 3

## 1. Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to practice the core subjects of Vue 3, including more complex topics like Vue 3 Router. It utilizes JavaScript and the Meals API to create an interactive recipe-finding application.

## 2. Live Project URL

The project is live at: [Recipe Finder Vue 3](https://recipes-finder-vue3.vercel.app/)

## 3. Description

This project allows users to search for recipes based on the main ingredient (e.g., chicken, fish, bacon) and type (e.g., seafood, dinner, soup). Additionally, it includes a dedicated section for Greek recipes. Users can click on any recipe to view detailed information. Under each recipe, there is a category by region (e.g., Italian, Greek, British), allowing users to find similar recipes from the same area.

Navigation is smooth, with multiple routes managed by Vue 3 Router. The layout includes sections with grid alignment, such as "Recipes by Type," "Recipes by Ingredient," and "Greek Recipes."
